## General info
This is an exercise for CodeCademy to create a simple website advertising a fake app that suggests travel destinations. I modified it a little to fit my own interests.

As I learn more about html and css I plan to update the website, hopefully making it more interesting, and possibly interactive.

## Technologies
The project was created with Html and CSS.
